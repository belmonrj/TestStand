This is the README file for the TestStand repository.
Note that currently a lot of files are not in use, but that
does not mean they won't be used again, nor that they don't
have any useful information in them.



BoxesBigTile.C (not currently in use) Draws one of the OHCal tiles and overlays the cosmics results

CompareProjections.C (not currently in use) Compares 1d projections of the smart tiles for different configurations of light blocking

CompareScans.C (not currently in use) Compares 1d projections of the smart tiles for different scans of the same tile

CosmicsVertSim.C (not currently in use) Does Toy MC of cosmics traveling through a block of material

DrawAsymmetry.C (not currently in use) Compares different methods of determining the core/cladding fractions for the smart tiles

DrawProjections.C (not currently in use) Compares different projections from the same scan for the smart tiles

analyzerV2_mean.C (not currently in use) Converts raw data from text files into 2d histograms (smart tiles)

analyzer_bigtile.C (will soon be in use, but needs an update to merge separate scan pieces) Converts raw data from text files into 2d histograms (OHCal tiles)

analyzer_new_LEDscan.C (not currently in use but a very good candidate for a single LED scan macro, has built-in option for scan offset) Converts raw data from text files into 2d histograms (IHCal and OHCal tiles)

analyzer_smalltile.C (currently in use, a very good candidate for a single LED scan macro, has 1d distributions for assessing tile variance) Converts raw data from text files into 2d histograms (IHCal tiles)

backgrounds.C (not currently in use) Does a careful study of SiPM data of backgrounds only (no source, no LED, no tile)

bethe.C (not currently in use) Does a careful calculation of the Bethe formula to determine the energy deposited in a scintillating tile

bigtilecosmics.C (not currently in use) Does a suite of calculations on raw text data for cosmics scans of the OHCal tiles

drawbig107.C (not currently in use) Draws an OHCal panel and lines to represent the projection slices

panelboxes.C (not currently in use) Draws a smart tile and adds lines to represent the projection slices

pedestal.C (not currently in use) Does a 1d histogram to study the pedestal in our signal chain (no SiPM, just preamp, logic unit, etc)

pixels_1d.C (not currently in use) Toy MC to study saturation effects in SiPMs

simplecosmics.C (not currently in use) Reads in raw text files from cosmics scan, makes a 1d distribution histograms, and studies the fits

singleslice.C (not currently in use) Studies 1d projections of the smart tiles

smalltilecosmics.C (not currently in use) Does a suite of calculations on raw text data for cosmics scans of the IHCal tiles

source.C (not currently in use) Does a suite of calculations on raw text data for Strontium source over a smart tile

yslice.C (not currently in use) Studies 1d projections of the 2d data from smart tiles

yslice_bigtile.C (not currently in use) Studies 1d projections of the 2d data from OHCal tiles

yslice_compare_LEDscan.C (not currently in use, missing data) Compares 1d projections of scans of HCal tiles to study differences between 405nm, 375nm, 361nm LEDs

yslice_new_LEDscan.C (not currently in use) Studies 1d projections of smart tile scans, incongrous name with analyzer_new_LEDscan.C (...)

yslice_smalltile.C (note currently in use) Studies 1d projections of the 2d data from IHCal tiles
