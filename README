README file for HCal test stand code


this is the compiled code for performing the scans

1) step2.cpp - essential, communicates with the stepper motors and oscilloscope to perform scans

2) stepX.cpp - mostly useless, contains old dead code removed from step2 for examination

these are the macros for analyzing the data:

1) analyzeV2_mean - essential to run, converts raw data text files into 2d histograms

2) YSlice - essential to run, converts 2d histograms into 1d projection histogram

3) histoDraw - produces 2d plots with the y-axis swapped and a custom color palette

4) DrawProjections - draws the different projections from the same scan together

5) DrawAsymmetry - draws SiPM1 and SiPM2 together, and calculates and draws the asymmetry

6) CompareProjections - compares the same projections from different scans

7) CompareScans - compares the same projections and scans from different days/times

8) Landau - analysis single position peak distribution data, compares to Landau distribution

9) simplecosmics - early draft of cosmics code, to eventually be melded into Landau...

these are some spare macros from playing around:

1) a1full3strip - looks at some old raw data, calculates an average and asymmetry

2) plotfit - calculates an asymmetry and fits it with a 2-component light yield model

3) DrawDiscrim - looks at raw data from the discriminator to determine the best voltage setting

4) panelboxes - draws the panel, showing the position of the fibers and scans

these are compiled codes for playing around---all compiled codes are compiled with compile.sh

5) dostats - does a simple statistical analysis on the PE/Volts calibration

6) roughcosmics - simple code for doing analysis of the early cosmics data
